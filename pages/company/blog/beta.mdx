# Beta Test üê∂

Welcome to Lumiere, my very first attempt at a large-scale software project! Thank you so very much for beta testing :))

Lumiere is a content creation platform made specifically for Hack Club students. The idea is to promote [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) and help students gain a following through their technical skills.

I have lots of cool things to show you, let's check em out!

## First Impressions

![Two ways to get to Lumiere Press](/images/beta/press.png)

You can see a public feed through either of the two buttons, no sign-in required. See what others have published already!

![Access the editor](/images/beta/editor.png)

To access the editor, you need to sign in with GitHub or Google, then set a username. The blue sign-in button will be replaced by your profile, where you can access `New Publication`.

## MDX Editor

Here's some information about how the editor was built!

### The MDX language

![MDX](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37453691?s=280&v=4)

Our editor uses [MDX syntax](https://mdxjs.com/).

- MDX = a combination of Markdown + JSX
- Markdown is really productive for writing _content_
- JSX is perfect for adding _interactive components_ to your articles

> MDX also gives us an odd mix of two languages: markdown is whitespace sensitive and forgiving (what you type may not ‚Äúwork‚Äù, but it won‚Äôt crash) whereas JavaScript is whitespace insensitive and does crash on typos. Weirdly enough they combine pretty well!

### `xdm`

To evaluate the MDX during runtime, we take full advantage of [`xdm`](https://github.com/wooorm/xdm#what-is-mdx).

- ESM only, extremely fast, highly extensible through the Remark, Rehype, and new Recma ecosystems
- Allows the editor to evaluate live without any reloading!

### Editor First Impressions

![Our MDX editor](/images/beta/mdx-editor.png)

1. Resize the panels to adjust width of the editor and output
2. Give your article a title!
3. Type MDX in the left to get a live output in the right

---

## Cool things in the editor

1.  All of **Markdown + GitHub-flavored markdown** spec works!

````markdown
# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### 3

#### 4

##### 5

###### 6

> Block quote

- Unordered
- List

1. Ordered
2. List

A paragraph, introducing a thematic break:

---

```js
some.code();
```

Codeblocks come with automatic syntax highlighting!

a [link](https://example.com), an ![image](./image.png), some _emphasis_,
something **strong**, and finally a little `code()`.
````

```markdown
## Strikethrough

~one~ or ~~two~~ tildes.

## Table

| a   | b   |   c |  d  |
| --- | :-- | --: | :-: |

## Tasklist

- [ ] to do
- [x] done
```

> Find more in the [Official Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/)

---

2. **Syntax Highlighting** in Code Blocks

````markdown
```js
console.log("cool");
```

```jsx
export default function Header() {
  return (
    <div>
      <header>Header</header>
    </div>
  );
}
```
````

---

3. **Table of contents** automatically generated

Everytime you add a new heading, a Table of Contents is generated based on the heading levels.

![TOC](/images/beta/toc.png)

---

4. Extending markdown syntax: **Hints/Tips/Warnings**

Insert different colored hints like this:

```markdown
!> Here is a tip (green).

?> Here is a warning (yellow).

x> Here is an error (red).
```

---

5. Extending markdown syntax: **Emojis**

Thanks to [remark-emoji](https://github.com/rhysd/remark-emoji), you can embed any UTF-8 emoji using their shortcodes `:[shortcode]:`. These are also automatically inlined.

```markdown
:dog:

:cat:

:joy:
```

---

6. Supports **HTML**, if you'd like to style something by yourself

You can insert HTML, not just Markdown, into the editor. I am working on supporting [TailwindCSS styles](https://tailwindcss.com/) so you can customize the look of the article!

```html
<div>
  1. Item1 2. Item2
  <div>3. Item3</div>
</div>
```

---

7. **JSX Components** are infinitely extensible

Alright I think this is really cool! What was covered above was all Markdown, no JSX. Try inserting this into the editor:

```jsx
<ConfettiComponent />
```

When you click this, confetti flies out and it keeps track of its own _state_. Imagine the possibilities!

Alright, next try this:

```jsx
<CodeSandboxButton
  files={{
    "package.json": {
      content: {
        dependencies: {
          react: "latest",
          "react-dom": "latest",
        },
      },
    },
    "index.html": {
      content: `<div id="root"></div>`,
    },
  }}
>
  This goes to CodeSandbox, with all of the files defined as props
</CodeSandboxButton>
```

This embeds a button. We can even embed the iframe through the `<CodeSandboxEmbed />` component!

```jsx
<CodeSandboxEmbed
  files={{
    "package.json": {
      content: {
        dependencies: {
          react: "latest",
          "react-dom": "latest",
        },
      },
    },
    "index.html": {
      content: `<div id="root"></div>`,
    },
  }}
/>
```

Finally, just for fun, let's play TicTacToe in the browser!

```jsx
<TicTacToe />
```

This is not practical at all! But it showcases just how much you can do with JSX Components.

> Components are infinitely extensible. By no means are the above 4 examples the only use cases for them.

---

7. **Define your own JSX Components** using the `export` syntax

Similar to writing your own HTML, you are not just limited to the components that we let you use! Write your own using the export syntax.

```jsx
export const CoolComponent = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <a href="https://mdxjs.com/" target="_blank">
      {children}
    </a>
  );
};

<CoolComponent>This is pretty cool!</CoolComponent>;
```

## Features in the Lab

- _Any feature request_ by you!
- Import any npm package in the editor through some unpkg magic
- Customize theme and apply Tailwind styles throughout the article
- Text to speech on each article for easier consumption
- SWR and ISR for fast loading and skeletons
- Dashboard for stats
- Reading time and viewcount, comments, user profiles
- Light and dark theme for articles

---

## Contributing

Lumiere is completely [open source](https://github.com/AnthonyKuang/ProjectLumiere) and I would love any contributions! Built using Next.js, Prisma, Tailwind, Vercel ‚ù§Ô∏è

I am also looking towards expanding the team, dm me for more info! So far I've been the sole developer and definitely feeling a bit short-staffed üòÖ

# Final words

I am so grateful to each and every one of you! I've always looked forward to the day where I could build something like Lumiere, and I couldn't have done it without Hack Club :))

Let me know if I can help for any of your future endeavors, I'd be more than glad to!
