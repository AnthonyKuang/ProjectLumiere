Welcome to the repository of Project Lumiere, the CS publication platform with superpowers! This repository houses the source code for the website in its entirety, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=lumiere&utm_campaign=oss).
