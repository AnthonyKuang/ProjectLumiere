# Developer Onboarding

Welcome to **Project Lumiere!**

Our website, [projectlumiere.org](https://www.projectlumiere.org), is created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), a framework that builds on top of [React.js](https://reactjs.org). React is in turn built on top of JavaScript. It is styled with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), an utility-first CSS framwork that merges React JSX with CSS styles. We are deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Prerequisites for Developers

Due to a cutting-edge stack, contributors must be, at the very minimum, proficient in the following technologies:

1. JavaScript (React.js knowledge preferred)
2. CSS
3. Git and GitHub
